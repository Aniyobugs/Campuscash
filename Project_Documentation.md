## Introduction
CampusCash is a web platform connecting students, faculty, and stores to digitalize campus rewards. It incentivizes engagement (events, tasks) with "CampusCash Points," redeemable at campus stores, replacing inefficient paper coupons with a secure digital system.

## Relevance
CampusCash modernizes campus engagement by:
*   **Digitalizing Rewards:** Eliminates paper waste and fraud.
*   **Boosting Engagement:** Gamifies tasks and volunteering.
*   **Centralization:** Unifies Students, Faculty, Admins, and Stores on one platform.
*   **Efficiency:** Streamlines management for Admins and Faculty.

## Methodology
*   **Planning:** Defined four user roles (Admin, Faculty, Student, Store) and key features like Task Management and Point Redemption.
*   **Analysis:** Designed a secure, real-time system with Role-Based Access Control and a robust database schema.
*   **Implementation:** 
    *   **Frontend:** React.js, Vite, Material UI.
    *   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js.
    *   **Database:** MongoDB.
    *   **Security:** JWT, BCrypt, Socket.io.
*   **Testing:** Verified API endpoints, frontend components, and user flows (Assignment -> Reward).

## Findings & Recommendations
*   **Findings:** Digital points reduce admin work, volunteering is streamlined, and real-time alerts improve communication.
*   **Recommendations:** Develop a mobile app (React Native), add advanced analytics, and consider blockchain for immutable records.

## Conclusion
CampusCash successfully digitizes campus interactions, creating a win-win ecosystem where students are rewarded for active participation and tasks are easily managed. It lays the groundwork for a smarter, connected campus.
